# Assignment

* SET UP:
   - Sign up for [a p5.js web editor account](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org)
   - Sign up for the [ITP ICM Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/itp.nyu.edu/group/icm)
   - Sign up for a [Github Account](http://github.com).  You need it to edit this wiki page.

* DO:
   - Here is an optional ["take-home" quiz to test your knowledge](https://itpnyu.github.io/ICM-Quizzes/week1-drawing/).  We'll be releasing one of these each week for self-study.  We'll discuss answers next week in class.  
   - Create your own screen drawing: self-portrait, alien, monster, etc. Use 2D primitive shapes – `arc()`, `curve()`, `ellipse()`, `line()`, `point()`, `quad()`, `rect()`, `triangle()` – and basic color functions – `background()`, `colorMode()`, `fill()`, `noFill()`, `noStroke()`, `stroke()`. Remember to use `createCanvas()` to specify the dimensions of your window and wrap all of your code inside a `setup()` function. Here's a sample example: [Zoog](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/projects/Hywk0Ews)
   - Write a blog post about how computation applies to *your* interests.  This could be a subject you've studied, a job you've worked, a personal hobby, or a cause you care about.  What projects do you imagine making this term?  What projects do you love? (Review and contribute to the [ICM Inspiration Wiki page](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2017/wiki/Inspiration)). In the same post (or a new one), document the process of creating your sketch. What pitfalls did you run into? What could you not figure out how to do? How was the experience of using the web editor?  Did you post any issues to github?

* READ AND WATCH:
   - [Videos 1.1 - 1.3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) -- note these were a couple years ago and reference a different desktop editor which we are no longer using.
   - After you do your homework, watch 2.1 - 2.3 to preview next week's discussion.
   - If the YouTube ads / format bother you, please contact Daniel Shiffman for a link to a shared google drive folder.
   - If you prefer books, Chapters 1-3 of [Getting Started with p5.js](http://amzn.to/2ckixCW) cover the same material. If you are logged into the NYU network [you can read it for free](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/detail.action?docID=4333728).

* ASK QUESTIONS: Contribute at least 1 question below.
